# Scalable Data Infrastructure with Docker Redis and Message Queues in the Cloud

</div>

Create a scalable, high-availability data infrastructure that supports real-time data processing and caching using Docker, Redis, Linux, message queues, DNS, and load balancers. The infrastructure should demonstrate efficient data flow and resilience, focusing on fault tolerance, containerization, and message-based communication.
